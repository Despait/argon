package main

//Argon has two purposes. One as a library to allow the programmatic encryption and decryption of data; the
//other as a program which performs the encryption and decryption of files from the command line. (The
//idea being that a file would normally be kept in encrypted form, but might occasionally be decrypted
//if it had to be edited and then re-encrypted). This mimics the behaviour of ansible-vault.
